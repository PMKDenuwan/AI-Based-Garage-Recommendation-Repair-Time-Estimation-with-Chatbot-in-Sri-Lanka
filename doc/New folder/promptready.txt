I Need to create Mobile Application for "AI-Based Garage Recommendation and Repair Time Estimation with Chatbot " that meets following requirements using React Native + Node.js/Express.js + Mongodb + WebSocket + Maps Integration and ML Integration, AI Chatbot(GEMINI API with Image Uploading, Image enable, Image analyzing)This mobile application has four roles : Drivers(Main Users) ,Garages , Mechanics, Admin Portal
Admin portal serves also web portal.

I have already trained the model for repair time estimation, I also attached the model and dataset

AUTHENTICATION & PROFILE:
- User registration with email OTP verification (email verification for only first time, then user can add password)
- Profile management with Google Maps address picker (If I hard to integrate google map use openstreet with leaflet)
- Add/manage multiple vehicles (Suzuki Alto 2010-2025)
- Vehicle fields: model, year, mileage, transmission, registration

AI CHATBOT DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM:
- Conversational interface for fault reporting
- Natural language processing
- Image upload for dashboard photos (Gemini Vision API integration)
- Dynamic question flow based on fault category
- Extract: Fault Category, Fault Type, Severity (Minor/Moderate/Major)
- Display auto-filled diagnosis form showing:
  * Car Model, Year, Mileage (from profile)
  * Fault Category, Fault Type, Severity (from chatbot)
Output :
  - Parts required from AI CHATBOT
  - Repair time estimation -> Connect to external ML API for repair time estimation
  - Drivability assessment (Drivable/Not Drivable) from AI CHATBOT

GARAGE RECOMMENDATION (If Drivable):
- Show top 3 ranked garages based on: (for demonstration pick 5 garages/places within 2.5km around SLIIT ,Malabe, Sri Lanka with ratins and mechanics)
  * Availability (Available/Busy)
  * Distance (Google Maps Distance Matrix API) (If I hard to integrate google map, use openstreet with leaflet)
  * ETA calculation
  * Mechanic experience
  * User ratings (1-5 stars)
Need strong algoritm like follow : (This is example)
// 1. Distance Score (40% weight)
const distanceScore = garage.distance_km; // 2.1

// 2. Waiting Time Score (30% weight)
const totalWait = garage.queue_wait_minutes + garage.drive_time_minutes;
const waitScore = totalWait / 60; // (0 + 8) / 60 = 0.133

// 3. Rating Score (20% weight)
const ratingScore = 5 - garage.rating; // 5 - 4.3 = 0.7

// 4. Availability Score (10% weight)
const availabilityScore = 5 - garage.available_mechanics; // 5 - 3 = 2.0

// Composite Score (Lower is Better)
const compositeScore = (
    (distanceScore * 0.4) +
    (waitScore * 0.3) +
    (ratingScore * 0.2) +
    (availabilityScore * 0.1)
);

// Quick Fix: (2.1 × 0.4) + (0.133 × 0.3) + (0.7 × 0.2) + (2.0 × 0.1)
//          = 0.84 + 0.04 + 0.14 + 0.2 = 1.22 ✓ BEST

// Express Auto: (3.5 × 0.4) + (0.95 × 0.3) + (1.0 × 0.2) + (3.0 × 0.1)
//             = 1.4 + 0.285 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 2.185

// City Motors: (5.2 × 0.4) + (1.75 × 0.3) + (0.4 × 0.2) + (0 × 0.1)
//            = 2.08 + 0.525 + 0.08 + 0 = 2.685

// Final Ranking: Quick Fix (1.22) > Express Auto (2.185) > City Motors (2.685)

**Most Important :  Ebven Chatbot building, Need to The app should detect specific demo phrases and trigger pre-defined conversation flows:

TRIGGER PHRASE 1: "brake" OR "grinding" OR "brake noise"
→ Activates CASE 1: BRAKE ISSUE FLOW (Drivable)

TRIGGER PHRASE 2: "overheating" OR "overheat" OR "engine stopped"
→ Activates CASE 2: ENGINE OVERHEATING FLOW (Not Drivable)


CASE 1: BRAKE GRINDING (DRIVABLE FLOW)
