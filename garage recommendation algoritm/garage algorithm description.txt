🔢 STEP 1: Convert values to SAME UNITS
Garage	Distance (km)	Waiting (min)	Arrival (min)	Rating	Mechanics
G1	0.50	15	2	3.2	2
G2	0.55	0	2	4.2	3
G3	0.60	15	3	4.4	5
G4	0.60	0	3	4.0	3
G5	1.70	15	6	3.5	4
🔢 STEP 2: Find MAX values (for normalization)
maxDistance = 1.70 km
maxWaiting  = 15 min
maxArrival  = 6 min
maxMechanics = 5

⚖️ STEP 3: Weights (FIXED)
Distance  = 0.25
Waiting   = 0.30
Arrival   = 0.15
Rating    = 0.20
Mechanics = 0.10

🧮 STEP 4: Normalization Formulas
distanceNorm   = distance / maxDistance
waitNorm       = waiting / maxWaiting
arrivalNorm    = arrival / maxArrival
ratingNorm     = (5 - rating) / 5
mechanicNorm   = (maxMechanics - mechanics) / maxMechanics

🧮 STEP 5: FINAL SCORE CALCULATION
🏚️ Garage 01
distance = 0.50 / 1.70 = 0.29
waiting  = 15 / 15 = 1.00
arrival  = 2 / 6 = 0.33
rating   = (5 - 3.2)/5 = 0.36
mechanic = (5 - 2)/5 = 0.60


Final Score

(0.29×0.25)+(1.00×0.30)+(0.33×0.15)+(0.36×0.20)+(0.60×0.10)
= 0.553

🏚️ Garage 02
distance = 0.55 / 1.70 = 0.32
waiting  = 0 / 15 = 0
arrival  = 2 / 6 = 0.33
rating   = (5 - 4.2)/5 = 0.16
mechanic = (5 - 3)/5 = 0.40


Final Score

= 0.214 ✅

🏚️ Garage 03
distance = 0.60 / 1.70 = 0.35
waiting  = 15 / 15 = 1
arrival  = 3 / 6 = 0.50
rating   = (5 - 4.4)/5 = 0.12
mechanic = (5 - 5)/5 = 0


Final Score

= 0.487

🏚️ Garage 04
distance = 0.60 / 1.70 = 0.35
waiting  = 0 / 15 = 0
arrival  = 3 / 6 = 0.50
rating   = (5 - 4.0)/5 = 0.20
mechanic = (5 - 3)/5 = 0.40


Final Score

= 0.256

🏚️ Garage 05
distance = 1.70 / 1.70 = 1
waiting  = 15 / 15 = 1
arrival  = 6 / 6 = 1
rating   = (5 - 3.5)/5 = 0.30
mechanic = (5 - 4)/5 = 0.20


Final Score

= 0.790 ❌

🏆 FINAL RANKING (LOWEST SCORE = BEST)
Rank	Garage	Final Score
🥇 1	Garage 02	0.214
🥈 2	Garage 04	0.256
🥉 3	Garage 03	0.487
4	Garage 01	0.553
5	Garage 05	0.790
🔥 VIVA KILLER POINT (VERY IMPORTANT)

👉 Garage 01 is the nearest (500m)
❌ BUT not recommended due to:

High waiting time

Low rating

Fewer mechanics

✅ Garage 02 wins because:

Zero waiting

High rating

Fast arrival

Balanced distance

🎤 EXACT VIVA ANSWER (MEMORIZE)

“Our system does not recommend the nearest garage. It calculates a weighted composite score using distance, waiting time, arrival time, user ratings, and mechanic availability, then recommends the garage with the lowest score.”

✅ THIS IS:

Sharp ✅

Numerical ✅

Logical ✅

Examiner-proof ✅

Industry-style ✅
